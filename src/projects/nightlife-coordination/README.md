# Build a Nightlife Coordination App

## Objective
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to [this](https://yasser-nightlife-app.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Heroku.

## User stories
+ As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
+ As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
+ As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
+ As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

Hint: Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.

## Usage
add YELP_API_KEY to a .env file for api access.
